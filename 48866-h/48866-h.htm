  <h2 class='c006'><b><span class='xlarge'>OUR READERS SAY</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Clark Ashton Smith’s story ‘The
Ghoul’ is fascinating all the way
through and the plot one that fits in
with the treatment. I am anxiously
waiting for more poems by him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Supernatural Horror in Literature’
grows even more absorbing with
the dawn of the Horror Tale. It is
certainly something to tuck away and
think over. Especially interesting is
how the germ started and gained force
in our own country from the European
elements and the fact that superstition
is more prevalent in northern
blood than in southern, speaking racially—Latin
and the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The ‘Annals of the Jinns’ continues
well and R. H. Barlow can get
quite a story in so few words.”</p>

<div class='c009'><b>—Duane W. Rimel</b></div>

<p class='c007'>You will notice an excellent long poem
by Clark Ashton Smith in this issue.
We intend to lengthen the installments
of Lovecraft’s article in future issues—the
next part will take over two full
pages. Barlow’s sixth “Annals” will
probably appear next month.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very glad to see the new issue.
Smith’s article is extremely apt and
timely. I find that James tends to be
popularly under-appreciated. Barlow’s
tale is the best yet—he seems to improve
constantly. The verses of Messrs.
Lumley and Searight are haunting and
excellent. It’s a good idea to substitute
a department of general discussion
for ‘The Boiling Point’.”</p>

<div class='c009'><b>—H. P. </b></div>

<p class='c007'>“I enjoyed the January issue of
THE FANTASY FAN. Barlow’s
little tales are certainly clever, and I
hope you will print many of them. I
second the wish that you express in
your note at the end of the current
‘Boiling Point’ column.”</p>

<div class='c009'><b>—Clark Ashton Smith</b></div>

<p class='c007'>“I just got the February issue of
THE FANTASY FAN and I find
that it’s o.k., as usual. Marianne
Ferguson’s article was great!”</p>

<div class='c009'><b>—Ted. H. Lutwin</b></div>

<p class='c007'>“Just finished the February issue of
THE FANTASY FAN, and in common
words, it’s a honey! Marianne
Ferguson’s article about her visit to
Jules de Grandin was superb! I want
to cast my vote right now for another
article by Miss Ferguson real soon!</p>

<p class='c008'>“THE FANTASY FAN is now
six months old and should celebrate!
‘The Dweller’ by William Lumley
was a masterpiece, and Richard F.
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>Searight’s poem takes high honors in
this issue.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All in all; I think this semi-birthday
issue is fine. But there are a few
things I would like to make comments
about. ‘The Boiling Point’ should be
eliminated, but the readers’ column
should not be shortened! I agree with
Mrs. Wooley—you should not insert
a contents page, and thus cut out
some interesting feature that could occupy
the space. THE FANTASY FAN is going places!”</p>

<div class='c009'><b>—Bob Tucker</b></div>

<p class='c007'>As this is only our seventh issue, we
don’t believe it’s quite time to celebrate
our success(?)—however, we will be one
year old in September and might be
better off by then and feel justified in
whooping it up.</p>

<p class='c008'>We take great pleasure in presenting
the following letter from H. Koenig.
His letters are always thoroughly interesting
and instructive and we value them
as much as some of our articles:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The February issue of THE
FANTASY FAN was splendid and a
marked improvement over the previous
issue. It is rather difficult to pick
out any high spot; but the articles and
stories by Lovecraft, Barlow, Smith,
and Petaja were all fine, to say nothing
of the column, ‘Howl from the
Ether.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“I particularly enjoyed Clark Ashton
Smith’s article on M. R. James.
It was an admirable essay on an author
who is far too little known and appreciated
on this side of the water,
and I dare say, on the other side also.
Dr. James, who apparently has a tremendous
amount of antiquarian and
archeological information at his fingertips,
is also, in my humble opinion,
the greatest modern exponent of the
ghost story. I heartily second Smith’s
recommendation that all lovers of the
weird and supernatural procure a copy
of the Longman’s Green and Company
volume. They will not be disappointed.
Incidentally, for the information
of readers who are perhaps interested
in the separate volumes of
James’ work rather than in the complete
collection, the individual titles of
his books (not mentioned in Smith’s
article) are as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</div>
      <div class='line'>2. More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</div>
      <div class='line'>3. A Thin Ghost and Others</div>
      <div class='line'>4. A Warning to the Curious</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“By the way, M. R. James should
not be confused with G. P. R. James
who wrote that interesting romance,
‘The Castle of Ehrenstein, Its Lords
Spiritual and Temporal; Its Inhabitants
Earthly and Unearthly.’ This is
a book, which, while probably somewhat
tiresome to the general reader,
should prove of considerable interest
to the student of the ghost story (I am
fortunate to have a first edition of this
book in three volumes published in
1847).</p>

<p class='c008'>“Emil Petaja’s article on ‘Famous
Fantasy Fiction’ was also fine but to
me far too short. I could add dozens
of other interesting anthologies to his
list but a few of the more important
ones will suffice. Mr. Petaja called
attention to Dorothy Sayers’ ‘Omnibus
of Crime.’ It should be noted that
Miss Sayers edited a second series of
stories entitled, ‘Detection, Mystery,
and Horror.’ Another worth-while
group of stories has been collected and
edited by Montague Summers under
the title, ‘The Supernatural Omnibus.’
This volume has a splendid introduction
by the Rev. Summers and contains,
among other stories, ‘The Upper
Berth’ by Crawford, and ‘The
Damned Thing’ by Bierce. Another
well-rounded collection was gotten together
by Colin de la Mare under the
title, ‘They Walk Again.’ This book
contains ‘The Voice of the Night’ by
Hodgson and ‘The Beckoning Fair
One’ by Oliver Onions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps at times I have been
somewhat harsh in my criticisms, but
I am glad that you have taken them
in the right spirit.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='small'>We know that you will be pleased to
note that we are lengthening the installments
of Lovecraft’s article hereafter.</span></p>

  <span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
  <h2 class='c006'><b><span class='xlarge'>Gods of the North</span></b><br /> <br /><span class='large'>by Robert E. Howard</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The clangor of the swords had died
away, the shouting of the slaughter was
hushed; silence lay on the red-stained
snow. The pale bleak sun that glittered
so blindingly from the ice-fields and
the snow-covered plains struck sheens of
silver from rent corselet and broken blade,
where the dead lay in heaps. The
nerveless hand yet gripped the broken
hilt; helmeted heads, back-drawn in the
death throes, tilted red beards and golden
beards grimly upward, as if in last invocation
to Ymir the frost-giant.</p>

<p class='c008'>Across the red drifts and mail-clad
forms, two figures approached one another.
In that utter desolation only they
moved. The frosty sky was over them,
the white illimitable plain around them,
the dead men at their feet. Slowly
through the corpses they came, as ghosts
might come to a tryst through the
shambles of a world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their shields were gone, their corselets
dinted. Blood smeared their mail;
their swords were red. Their horned
helmets showed the marks of fierce strokes.</p>

<p class='c008'>One spoke, he whose locks and beard
were red as the blood on the sunlit snow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Man of the raven locks,” said he,
“tell me your name, so that my brothers
in Vanaheim may know who was
the last of Wulfhere’s band to fall before
the sword of Heimdul.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is my answer,” replied the
black-haired warrior: “Not in Vanaheim,
but in Vallhalla will you tell your brothers
the name of Amra of Akbitana.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Heimdul roared and sprang, and his
sword swung in a mighty arc. Amra
staggered and his vision was filled with
red sparks as the blade shivered into bits
of blue fire on his helmet. But as he
reeled he thrust with all the power of
his great shoulders. The sharp point
drove through brass scales and bones and
heart, and the red-haired warrior died
at Amra’s feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amra stood swaying, trailing his sword,
a sudden sick weariness assailing him.
The glare of the sun on the snow cut
his eyes like a knife and the sky seemed
shrunken and strangely far. He turned
away from the trampled expanse where
yellow-bearded warriors lay locked with
red-haired slayers in the embrace of death.
A few steps he took, and the glare of
the snow fields was suddenly dimmed.
A rushing wave of blindness engulfed
him, and he sank down into the snow,
supporting himself on one mailed arm,
seeking to shake the blindness out of his
eyes as a lion might shake his mane.</p>

<p class='c008'>A silvery laugh cut through his dizziness,
and his sight cleared slowly. There
was a strangeness about all the landscape
that he could not place or define—an
unfamiliar tinge to earth and sky. But he
did not think long of this. Before him,
swaying like a sapling in the wind, stood
a woman. Her body was like ivory,
and save for a veil of gossamer, she was
naked as the day. Her slender bare feet
were whiter than the snow they spurned.
She laughed, and her laughter was sweeter
than the rippling of silvery fountains, and
poisonous with cruel mockery.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>“Who are you?” demanded the
warrior.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What matter?” Her voice was more
musical than a silver-stringed harp, but
it was edged with cruelty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Call up your men,” he growled,
grasping his sword. “Though my
strength fail me, yet they shall not take
me alive. I see that you are of the
Vanir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have I said so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked again at her unruly locks,
which he had thought to be red. Now
he saw that they were neither red nor
yellow, but a glorious compound of both
colors. He gazed spell-bound. Her
hair was like elfin-gold, striking which,
the sun dazzled him. Her eyes were
neither wholly blue nor wholly grey, but
of shifting colors and dancing lights and
clouds of colors he could not recognize.
Her full red lips smiled, and from her
slim feet to the blinding crown of her
billowy hair, her ivory body was as perfect
as the dream of a god. Amra’s
pulse hammered in his temples.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can not tell,” said he, “whether
you are of Vanaheim and mine enemy,
or of Asgard and my friend. Far have
I wandered, from Zingara to the Sea of
Vilayet, in Stygia and Kush, and the
country of the Hyrkanians; but a woman
like you I have never seen. Your locks
blind me with their brightness. Not
even among the fairest daughters of the
Aesir have I seen such hair, by Ymir!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are you to swear by Ymir?”
she mocked. “What know you of the
gods of ice and snow, you who have
come up from the south to adventure
among strangers?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By the dark gods of my own race!”
he cried in anger. “Have I been backward
in the sword-play, stranger or no?
This day I have seen four score warriors
fall, and I alone survive the field where
Wulfhere’s reavers met the men of Bragi.
Tell me, woman, have you caught the
flash of mail across the snow-plains, or
seen armed men moving upon the ice?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have seen the hoar-frost glittering
in the sun,” she answered. “I have
heard the wind whispering across the
everlasting snows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Niord should have come up with us
before the battle joined. I fear he and
his warriors have been ambushed. Wulfhere
lies dead with all his weapon-men.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had thought there was no village
within many leagues of this spot, for the
war carried us far, but you can have
come no great distance over these snows,
naked as you are. Lead me to your
tribe, if you are of Asgard, for I am
faint with the weariness of strife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dwelling place is further than
you can walk, Amra of Akbitana!” she
laughed. Spreading wide her arms she
swayed before him, her golden head
lolling wantonly, her scintillant eyes
shadowed beneath long silken lashes.
“Am I not beautiful, man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Like Dawn running naked on the
snows,” he muttered, his eyes burning
like those of a wolf.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why do you not rise and follow
me? Who is the strong warrior
who falls down before me?” she chanted
in maddening mockery. “Lie down and
die in the snow with the other fools,
Amra of the black hair. You can not
follow where I would lead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With an oath the man heaved himself
upon his feet, his blue eyes blazing,
his dark scarred face convulsed. Rage
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>shook his soul, but desire for the taunting
figure before him hammered at his
temples and drove his wild blood riotiously
through his veins. Passion fierce
as physical agony flooded his whole being
so that earth and sky swam red to his
dizzy gaze, and weariness and faintness
were swept from him in madness.</p>

<p class='c008'>He spoke no word as he drove at her,
fingers hooked like talons. With a shriek
of laughter she leaped back and ran,
laughing at him over her white shoulder.
With a low growl Amra followed. He
had forgotten the fight, forgotten the
mailed warriors who lay in their blood,
forgotten Niord’s belated reavers. He
had thought only for the slender white
shape which seemed to float rather than
run before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Out across the white blinding plain
she led him. The trampled red field
fell out of sight behind him, but still
Amra kept on with the silent tenacity
of his race. His mailed feet broke
through the frozen crust; he sank deep
in the drifts and forged through them by
sheer strength. But the girl danced across
the snow as light as a feather floating
across a pool; her naked feet scarcely
left their imprint on the hoar-frost.
In spite of the fire in his veins, the
cold bit through the warrior’s mail and
furs; but the girl in her gossamer veil
ran as lightly and as gaily as if she
danced through the palms and rose
gardens of Poitain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Black curses drooled through the warrior’s
parched lips. The great veins
swelled and throbbed in his temples,
and his teeth gnashed spasmodically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can not escape me!” he roared.
“Lead me into a trap and I’ll pile the
heads of your kinsmen at your feet.
Hide from me and I’ll tear apart the
mountains to find you! I’ll follow you
to hell and beyond hell!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her maddening laughter floated back
to him, and foam flew from the warrior’s
lips. Further and further into the
wastes she led him, till he saw the wide
plains give way to low hills, marching
upward in broken ranges. Far to the
north he caught a glimpse of towering
mountains, blue with the distance, or
white with the eternal snows. Above
these mountains shone the flaring rays of
the borealis. They spread fan-wise into
the sky, frosty blades of cold flaming
light, changing in color, growing and
brightening.</p>

<p class='c008'>Above him the skies glowed and crackled
with strange lights and gleams. The
snow shone weirdly, now frosty blue,
now icy crimson, now cold silver.
Through a shimmering icy realm of enchantment
Amra plunged doggedly onward,
in a crystalline maze where the
only reality was the white body dancing
across the glittering snow beyond his
reach—ever beyond his reach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet he did not wonder at the necromantic
strangeness of it all, not even
when two gigantic figures rose up to bar
his way. The scales of their mail were
white with hoar-frost; their helmets and
their axes were sheathed in ice. Snow
sprinkled their locks; in their beards
were spikes of icicles; their eyes were
cold as the lights that streamed above
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Brothers!” cried the girl, dancing
between them. “Look who follows! I
have brought you a man for the feasting!
Take his heart that we may lay
it smoking on our father’s board!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The giants answered with roars like
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>the grinding of ice-bergs on a frozen
shore, and heaved up their shining axes
as the maddened Akbitanan hurled himself
upon them. A frosty blade flashed
before his eyes, blinding him with its
brightness, and he gave back a terrible
stroke that sheared through his foe’s
thigh. With a groan the victim fell, and
at the instant Amra was dashed into the
snow, his left shoulder numb from the
blow of the survivor, from which the
warrior’s mail had barely saved his life.
Amra saw the remaining giant looming
above him like a colossus carved of ice,
etched against the glowing sky. The axe
fell, to sink through the snow and deep
into the frozen earth as Amra hurled
himself aside and leaped to his feet. The
giant roared and wrenched the axe-head
free, but even as he did so, Amra’s
sword sank down. The giant’s knees
bent and he sank slowly into the snow
which turned crimson with the blood that
gushed from his half-severed neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amra wheeled, to see the girl standing
a short distance away, staring in
wide-eyed horror, all mockery gone from
her face. He cried out fiercely and the
blood-drops flew from his sword as his
hand shook in the intensity of his
passion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Call the rest of your brothers!” he
roared. “Call the dogs! I’ll give their
hearts to the wolves!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a cry of fright she turned and
fled. She did not laugh now, nor mock
him over her shoulder. She ran as for
her life, and though he strained every
nerve and thew, until his temples were
like to burst and the snow swam red to
his gaze, she drew away from him,
dwindling in the witch-fire of the skies,
until she was a figure no bigger than a
child, then a dancing white flame on
the snow, then a dim blur in the distance.
But grinding his teeth until the
blood started from his gums, he reeled
on, and he saw the blur grow to a dancing
white flame, and the flame to a
figure big as a child; and then she was
running less than a hundred paces ahead
of him, and slowly the space narrowed,
foot by foot.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was running with effort now,
her golden locks blowing free; he heard
the quick panting of her breath, and saw
a flash of fear in the look she cast over
her alabaster shoulder. The grim endurance
of the warrior had served him
well. The speed ebbed from her flashing
white legs; she reeled in her gait.
In his untamed soul flamed up the fires
of hell she had fanned so well. With
an inhuman roar he closed in on her,
just as she wheeled with a haunting cry
and flung out her arms to fend him off.</p>

<p class='c008'>His sword fell into the snow as he
crushed her to him. Her supple body
bent backward as she fought with desperate
frenzy in his iron arms. Her
golden hair blew about his face, blinding
him with its sheen; the feel of her
slender figure twisting in his mailed arms
drove him to blinder madness. His
strong fingers sank deep into her smooth
flesh, and that flesh was cold as ice.
It was as if he embraced not a woman
of human flesh and blood, but a woman
of flaming ice. She writhed her golden
head aside, striving to avoid the savage
kisses that bruised her red lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are cold as the snows,” he
mumbled dazedly. “I will warm you
with the fire in my own blood—”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a desperate wrench she twisted
from his arms, leaving her single gossamer
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>garment in his grasp. She sprang back
and faced him, her golden locks in wild
disarray, her white bosom heaving, her
beautiful eyes blazing with terror. For
an instant he stood frozen, awed by her
terrible beauty as she posed naked against
the snows.</p>

<p class='c008'>And in that instant she flung her arms
toward the lights that glowed in the skies
above her and cried out in a voice that
rang in Amra’s ears for ever after:</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Ymir! Oh, my father, save me!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Amra was leaping forward, arms spread
to seize her, when with a crack like the
breaking of an ice mountain, the whole
skies leaped into icy fire. The girl’s
ivory body was suddenly enveloped in a
cold blue flame so blinding that the warrior
threw up his hands to shield his
eyes. A fleeting instant, skies and snowy
hills were bathed in crackling white
flames, blue darts of icy light, and frozen
crimson fires. Then Amra staggered
and cried out. The girl was gone.
The glowing snow lay empty and bare;
high above him the witch-lights flashed
and played in a frosty sky gone mad,
and among the distant blue mountains
there sounded a rolling thunder as of a
gigantic war-chariot rushing behind steeds
whose frantic hoofs struck lightning from
the snows and echoes from the skies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then suddenly the borealis, the snowy
hills and the blazing heavens reeled drunkenly
to Amra’s sight; thousands of fireballs
burst with showers of sparks, and
the sky itself became a titanic wheel
which rained stars as it spun. Under
his feet the snowy hills heaved up like a
wave, and the Akbitanan crumpled into
the snows to lie motionless.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a cold dark universe, whose sun
was extinguished eons ago, Amra felt the
movement of life, alien and unguessed.
An earthquake had him in its grip and
was shaking him to and fro, at the same
time chafing his hands and feet until he
yelled in pain and fury and groped for
his sword.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s coming to, Horsa,” grunted a
voice. “Haste—we must rub the frost
out of his limbs, if he’s ever to wield
sword again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He won’t open his left hand,” growled
another, his voice indicating muscular
strain. “He’s clutching something—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Amra opened his eyes and stared into
the bearded faces that bent over him.
He was surrounded by tall golden-haired
warriors in mail and furs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Amra! You live!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By Crom, Niord,” gasped he, “am
I alive, or are we all dead and in
Valhalla?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We live,” grunted the Aesir, busy
over Amra’s half-frozen feet. “We had
to fight our way through an ambush, else
we had come up with you before the
battle was joined. The corpses were
scarce cold when we came upon the
field. We did not find you among the
dead, so we followed your spoor. In
Ymir’s name, Amra, why did you wander
off into the wastes of the north?
We have followed your tracks in the
snow for hours. Had a blizzard come
up and hidden them, we had never
found you, by Ymir!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Swear not so often by Ymir,” muttered
a warrior, glancing at the distant
mountains. “This is his land and the
god bides among yonder mountains, the
legends say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I followed a woman,” Amra answered
hazily. “We met Bragi’s men
in the plains. I know not how long
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>we fought. I alone lived. I was dizzy
and faint. The land lay like a dream
before me. Only now do all things
seem natural and familiar. The woman
came and taunted me. She was beautiful
as a frozen flame from hell. When
I looked at her I was as one mad, and
forgot all else in the world. I followed
her. Did you not find her tracks. Or
the giants in icy mail I slew?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Niord shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We found only your tracks in the
snow, Amra.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then it may be I was mad,” said
Amra dazedly. “Yet you yourself are
no more real to me than was the golden
haired witch who fled naked across the
snows before me. Yet from my very
hands she vanished in icy flame.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is delirious,” whispered a warrior.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not so!” cried an older man, whose
eyes were wild and weird. “It was
Atali, the daughter of Ymir, the frost-giant!
To fields of the dead she comes,
and shows herself to the dying! Myself
when a boy I saw her, when I lay
half-slain on the bloody field of Wolraven.
I saw her walk among the dead in the
snows, her naked body gleaming like
ivory and her golden hair like a blinding
flame in the moonlight. I lay and howled
like a dying dog because I could not
crawl after her. She lures men from
stricken fields into the wastelands to be
slain by her brothers, the ice-giants, who
lay men’s red hearts smoking on Ymir’s
board. Amra has seen Atali, the frost-giant’s
daughter!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bah!” grunted Horsa. “Old Gorm’s
mind was turned in his youth by a sword
cut on the head. Amra was delirious
with the fury of battle. Look how his
helmet is dinted. Any of those blows
might have addled his brain. It was an
hallucination he followed into the wastes.
He is from the south; what does he
know of Atali?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You speak truth, perhaps,” muttered
Amra. “It was all strange and
weird—by Crom!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He broke off, glaring at the object
that still dangled from his clenched left
fist; the others gaped silently at the veil
he held up—a wisp of gossamer that was
never spun by human distaff.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>“Gandle Follows His Nose” by
Heywood Broun (Boni &amp; Liveright 1926).
Our Scripps-Howard correspondent turns
out a short allegorical fantasy which concerns
itself with the adventures of one
Bunny Gandle who, when 18 years of
age, was taken, by his uncle, to the
sorcerer Boaz, wherefrom he managed to
escape with the cape of invisibility. We
travel with him to strange lands. We
hear of his finding and the subsequent
loss of the magic lamp, his victory over
the God Kla, the repulsion of the armies
of King Helgas, and his sojourn in the
Land of the Flying Sword. We meet
our old friend, Yom, the genie who is
much perturbed when Gandle orders him
to bring a poached egg, of all things.
Yom, incidentally, tenders young Gandle
some sage advice concerning Life which
the youth cannot grasp. Who can
blame him, as the genie had 5694 years
of experience? The underlying current
in this piece is that of “wishfulfilment,”
which I think, was what Broun primarily
had in mind. It makes novel reading
from all angles.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Through the seventeenth and into
the eighteenth century, we behold a
growing mass of fugitive legendry and
balladry of darksome cast; still, however,
held down beneath the surface
of polite and accepted literature. Chap-books
of horror and weirdness multiplied,
and we glimpse the eager interest
of the people through fragments
like DeFoe’s <i>Apparition of Mrs. Veal</i>,
a homely tale of a dead woman’s
spectral visit to a distant friend, written
to advertise covertly a badly selling
theological disquisition on death.
The upper orders of society were now
losing faith in the supernatural, and indulging
in a period of classic rationalism.
Then, beginning with the translations
of Eastern tales in Queen Anne’s
reign and taking definite form toward
the middle of the century, comes the
revival of romantic feeling—the era of
new joy in Nature, and in the radiance
of past times, strange scenes, bold
deeds, and incredible marvels. We
feel it first in the poets, whose utterances
take on new qualities of wonder,
strangeness, and shuddering. And
finally, after the timid appearance of a
few weird scenes in the novels of the
day—such as Smollett’s <i>Adventures of
Ferdinand, Count Fathom</i>—the released
instinct precipitates itself in the birth
of a new school of writing; the
“Gothic” school of horrible and fantastic
prose fiction, long and short,
whose literary posterity is destined to
become so numerous, and in many
cases so resplendent in artistic merit.
It is, when one reflects upon it, genuinely
remarkable that weird narration
as a fixed and academically recognized
literary form should have been so late
of final birth. The impulse and atmosphere
are as old as man, but the typical
weird tale of standard literature is
a child of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c008'>(Next month we will give you a
much longer installment of this article,
in which Mr. Lovecraft takes up the
third section, “The Early Gothic
Novel.”)</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><b><span class='xlarge'>YOUR VIEWS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You will remember that, in the
closing statement in the last department
of “The Boiling Point” last
month, we asked you, the readers, to
tell us what you think of horror stories.
Is there any virtue to them? Why do
people delight in being horrified?—etc.
suggested by Forrest J. Ackerman.
H. P. Lovecraft honors us with the
first opinion, which we present to you
as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“It can be said that anything which
vividly embodies a basic human emotion
or captures a definite and typical
human mood is genuine art. The subject
matter is immaterial. It requires
an especial morbidity to enjoy any authentic
word-depiction, whether it is
conventionally ‘pleasant’ or not. Indeed,
it argues a somewhat immature
and narrow prospection when our judgment
is by the mere conventional appeal
of its subject-matter or its supposed
social effects. The question to ask
is not whether it is ‘healthy’ or ‘pleasant,’
but whether it is <i>genuine</i> and
<i>powerful</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Have you another idea concerning
the horror story? If so, let us know
what it is. However, if your opinion
differs, don’t tell Mr. Lovecraft that
he is crazy or has a diseased mind
for thinking as he does, or this department
will just become another ‘Boiling
Point.’ Or bring up something
new, if you will. This is your department,
and anything you wish to say
concerning weird fiction in general or
any of its branches in particular will
be printed here. Here’s hoping to
hear from you.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>On one evening in 1916, before the
United States had entered the World
War, I happened to be out with my
mother. The place was Bridgeport,
Connecticut, near the corner of Main
and State Streets. The stars were
shining, as usual, though I gave them
no particular notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had turned the corner and traversed
several feet, when I chanced
to look up into the sky. Lo and behold,
the stars had formed themselves
into one great patch in the heavens,
in the form of letters, and those letters
spelled words!</p>

<p class='c008'>I could read some, at the time, but
I tugged at my mother’s arm and asked
her what it said. I am hazy as to
her answer. Perhaps she told me that
there was nothing there, or ignored
the childish gesture entirely. At any
rate, I looked up again and the words
were still there. I don’t believe that
my mother even glanced at them.</p>

<p class='c008'>You are anxious to learn what it
said? Well, it took years for that
memory to come back to me, but I
now have it, in what I am fairly sure
are the correct words. The exact
ones do not make any difference, for
I am sure of their meaning. The
message in the sky read, “The United
States of America will run red
with blood!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A short time after peering at the
stars, some invisible forces took hold
of them. The brilliant orbs were
shifted as by a mighty hand. They
moved like checkers on a vast board.
And then, the stars ceased their journeyings;
they were once more on
their accustomed courses. I lowered
my head; the gigantic show was
over!</p>

<p class='c008'>Delusion, you say? I’m afraid I
don’t agree with you.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><b><span class='xlarge'>HOW TO WRITE A WEIRD TALE</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='large'>by Hoy Ping Pong</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Unlike its sister, the science fiction
story, the weird tale needs a plot. To
go about this, select the plot which
has been used most since 1926 and
write your tale around it. I said
<i>around</i>. Don’t touch the plot itself;
editors won’t stand for that! Above
all, <i>don’t</i> invent an original one. Readers
won’t know what you’re talking about
if you don’t use one that has been
plotted 6,438,900 and a fraction times,
more or less. At this point, you can
discard the plot altogether, because
the editor would send your brain-child
back if you didn’t, on the grounds
that there are too many stories with
plots in them as it is. They would
rather have action.</p>

<p class='c008'>Action—that is the keynote! The
hero must dash hither and thither over
the landscape, saving the beautiful blue
eyed heroine, who lisps in baby-talk,
from the snakey clutches of the villain
who, incidentally, is about to let loose
on the city a horde of terrible monsters.
Where he got them from is none of
your business, so you’d do much better
to worry yourself about something
else—where your next meal is coming
from, for instance. I would suggest
that pre-historic monsters be used, for
they are easier to account for than ones
from other dimensions. Editors have
an annoying habit of asking authors
where their monsters came from. You
had better have the monsters destroy
New York City. The inhabitants of
this city are so used to being destroyed
that they now take it with a chuckle of
droll humor. The tax payers might
protest a bit though, but don’t mind
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here to add a bit of flavor to the
tale, bring in a new plot. Discard it
and bring in a third. Throw that one
away too. Plots are cheap—$1.75 an
acre in Missouri. Small plots will do.
Then, while the stunned readers are
still gasping over the plots, throw in a
barrage of big words that none of them
will understand, including Webster and
Clark Ashton Smith. This will stupefy
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>About this time, put in something
really weird and spine-chilling. Ice
might do, but it melts too rapidly in
warm climes, and a southern reader
wouldn’t get his spine thoroughly chilled,
so you had better devise something
else.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a final bit of advice, it would be
best to have some sort of recommendation
to the editor in order to have
your story more readily acceptable. So
have your Uncle Silas, who has a
friend that knows a friend who is an
acquaintance with someone that
knows the printer who publishes the
said editor’s magazine, put in a good
word for you.</p>

<p class='c008'>If this fails (as it undoubtedly will)
take your brain-child to him in person.
This will save postage both ways, because
editors never fail to reject manuscripts
from beginners (I object—Editor).
Don’t worry over this tho.
Let it lay around home a few weeks
mellowing with age, and then send it
in again, untouched. This time it
will be accepted. Maybe.</p>

<p class='c008'>If you go in person, buy a plot in a
local cemetery.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><b><span class='xlarge'>A SAD STORY OF THE FUTURE</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='large'>by Forrest J. Ackerman</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>(Following is a brief summary of a
recent radio broadcast taken from the
story “We Buy Us a Robot—and
What Happened” in the American
Weekly.)</p>

<p class='c008'>A married couple had an eight year
old robot, and decided that it was about
time to get a new one as ‘Willy’
was becoming worn and creaky and
inefficient; so, they went to look over
the newest models. They selected
Julius, a most capable iron-man who
could not tell a lie. This proved a
disadvantage, however, as, upon entering
their home he declared in his deep,
hollow, mechanical voice: “Dust—much dust!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As the wife would grow lonely when
her husband was away, she had a phonograph
record made of him assuring her
how much he loved her. This she inserted
into Julius, and listened to him.
But this made Julius become very
pensive and sad. One day he was
found reading love poems and crying.
Julius was in love! He realized the
hopelessness of the situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day he was found missing.
“Oh! He’s committed suicide!” the
wife cried, “I know it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But that’s impossible!” her husband
assured her, “if he tries to drown
himself, he will only be short-circuited
and rusted, and could be revitalized
and polished up just like new. If he
shoots himself, but a few parts need
be replaced. Jumping from a window
would merely dent him a little. He
cannot hang himself; he cannot poison
himself; he cannot die by fire. Anyhow,
our contract guarantees us against
loss by suicide.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then the televisor flashed on.
It was an upstairs neighbor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My son’s all dirty and greasy,”
he bellowed, “and it’s your fault!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our fault? How so?” they asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>He gave a serial number. “That’s
your robot, isn’t it? Well, he went
out into the park and called a lot of
kids around him; told them he wasn’t
feeling well; gave them screw-drivers
and asked to find out what was the
matter with him. In a few minutes
he was scattered all over six blocks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Julius, the mechanical man, had
taken the only method an automaton
knew of committing suicide.——</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The first publication of the tale that
later became Wells’ most famous short
novel, was in a paper issued at his
school. The magazine, The Science
Schools Quarterly, serialized a story
of the same underlying plot, dealing
with a Welsh professor. This was,
broadly speaking, the debut of the
story. It was later re-written, and
some decade afterwards, after being
published in both the National Observer
and The New Review, appeared
in a modest little volume published by
Wm. Heinomann. Preceding it were
two text-books and Conversations
With An Uncle came out the day immediately
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>The book in its first English edition,
was a modest duodecimo volume measuring
approximately 7 X 5 X 1 ins.
It was bound in a coarse linen-like grey
cloth, and bore in purple lettering as
well as the title a peculiar device of a
rather emaciated sphinx. It contained
pages 152 and XVI. The text, besides
the title page was virtually the same as
that recently issued in Short Stories of
H. G. Wells, but differed in several
respects from that Amazing Stories
used in their May, 1927 issue.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appeared simultaneously both in
the bound edition and wrappers, the
former at the price of 3s, and the latter
at 2s 6d.</p>
